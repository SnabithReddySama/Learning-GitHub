# Learning-GitHub
Before any branching and commits (initial phase).

Editing on a new branch "readme- branch".   // Trying commit details too!

//New information:
  The master remained the same before pulling it. A branch is a copy on which we experiment. Once it is done, we kinda make it master.
  Wow, it has auto indentation too! I must start improving my formal english.

Just created a new branch to know more about changes!
  // When I saw the main page after merging, it showed me "I learn a new thing" beside readme.md
  //It is the name given to a commit, well last commit. So trying a new name and checking.

I understood that the tag beside readme.md is about the latest commit made. Hence this commit should show the desired results.
